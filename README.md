Instructions

Create a simple iOS app for weather forecasting. It should show the actual weather for your current location. 


Minimal functionality:

In the forecast tab, show the forecast for the next 5 days (in 3 hour intervals) at your current location.
Make sure you consider and handle all possible states of the app (offline, data not loading, errors, etc). 

Nice to have functionality:

Implement Dark mode in the app. 

Use:				
Swift 5.* versions
Create layout in code using autolayout. (Allowed to use third-party layout library using Cocoapods)
MVVM/MVP
Open Weather Map API (http://openweathermap.org/api).
Geolocation for determining the current position of the device (use Core Location to get the GPS data).
Use the design for the application provided below (it is mockup, not final design)
Share weather as text


Result:

Code should be published to a public repository on GitHub
Repository should contains commit history instead of single one
Select icons by yourself. App should contain non-default launch icon
Link should be provided to interviewer
